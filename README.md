# LibreChat Cloudron package

This is my first try packaging apps for cloudron.

Sources : https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat

## How to use it

This app is not currently officialy packaged and supported by Cloudron team. To test an installation with this repository image run `cloudron install` with `vlebert/librechat` docker image.

## Todo

- Fix configuration to works with Cloudron OIDC SSO
- add RAG API for file upload and interraction
